# Mood tracking app

This is a web-app for tracking mood, health, etc, written in React.
Dropbox is used for data storage.

The app can be accessed at <https://moodtracker.bitballoon.com>.

Tracked quantities are called "metrics".
Data entry forms are displayed at the top of the app.
Below the entry forms are graphs that display the logged data.
At the bottom is a settings panel for creating/deleting/modifying metrics.
One can change a metric's name, minimum and maximum values, and color-code value-ranges.
(The specified colors will affect the colors of the data entry buttons but don't have an effect on the graphs yet.)
